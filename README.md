# Classification of Brain Tumors using Deep Learning Architecture
This project aims to compare the evaluation results of three deep learning architectures:
VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception for brain tumor classification cases, which consist of two
labels: normal and abnormal.

## Dataset
The dataset can be accessed at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z2bIM-roinJbA_1DYgaKqW0ntm-X0g7i?usp=sharing 

The dataset is divided into two parts, train and test (Request for access is required).

## Directory
The directories in the notebook file are adjusted according to the needs.

## Output project
Perbandingan hasil evaluasi dari ketiga arsitektur yang digunakan
